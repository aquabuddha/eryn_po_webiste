## Home Page for Eryn Price-Orsmby website,

While the basic structure and design has stayed the same, I've updated the site to be responsive in three different view sizes, including a floating header in larger view sizes and a sliding menu for mobile formats.

## Custom Classes

I actually have quite a bit, so I guess I'm just going to pick three and list their purposes.

```
.main-nav - set the text to uppercase, all padding to 0px, and the background to white.

#welcome - centers the welcome div and sets the width to take up 75% of the wrapper div.

#photo2 - floats the pic to the left and adds right padding and top margie
```



## Custom JavaScript

```
openNav() - Sets the width of the menu navigation to 100% when the Menu item is clicked and adds the "slide" class to mobile-nav in order to provide the transition effect.

closeNav() - Sets the width of the menu navigation to 0% when the X is clicked, effectively closing the mobile menu.
```
